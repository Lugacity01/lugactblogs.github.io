              <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>wo of the most recent phones from Samsung which are the S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra compared. And many of you have been wondering whether it is worthwhile to go from the S22 Ultra to the S23 Ultra.
                Well, we'll find out by the end of this post.
                </p>

              <figure class="my-4 text-center" >
                <img src="assets/img/s22-ultra-vs-s23-ultra.jpg" width="60%" height="60%" alt="an image showing Samsung s22 ultra side-by-side Samsung s23 ultra" class="img-fluid">
               
              </figure>
              <p>
                Below are factors you may consider in order for you to choose the right one for you.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Design</h2>

              <p>They both look quite exactly the same,
                particularly, if you've got the phantom black version
                side by side.
                You won't likely be able to distinguish between them.
                While the S22 Ultra does have a really lovely design, I still like the S21 Ultra as my favorite recent Samsung design, however, that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
                There are, however, a few minute variations.
                First off, our newly created curvature gives you a larger flat area.
                Therefore, even though the sides of the S23 Ultra are slightly curved, they are not as curved as the sides of the S22 Ultra, giving it a more boxy appearance, which I prefer.
                Therefore, if you already own a case for the S22 Ultra and decide to save money by not purchasing one when you upgrade to the S23 Ultra, that case will unfortunately not quite fit.
                Putting that aside, they are essentially the same size.
                The S23 Ultra does, however, weigh a few grams extra.
                Both of these have an aluminum frame with armor so that part is identical. Additionally, the S22 Ultra comes in a variety of colors, including burgundy, green, phantom black, and phantom white.

                In addition to phantom black, the S23 Ultra is now also offered in cream, green, and lavender.
                Four more colors were available when the S22 Ultra was first announced, in addition to certain exclusive colors only available at Samsung.com.
                As far as I can tell, Samsung no longer sells such products directly.
                Of course, you might be able to get those colors if you wish to choose a used sub.
                You can presently purchase the S23 Ultra in Samsung's unique color options.
                Thus, we have lime, red, sky blue, and graphite.

                
                
              </p>

              <h2>Cameras</h2>
              <p>We have a system that is nearly identical.
                So, in addition to a selfie camera, we also have a primary camera, an ultra-wide camera, a three-times telephoto camera, and a ten-times periscope zoom camera.
                Let's start by discussing what is the same.
                Therefore, as far as I can tell, the hardware for the ultra-wide camera is the same.
                It remains really good.
                One of my favorite ultra-wide cameras of 2022 was the S22 Ultra.
                And from what I can tell in decent daylight, they both appear to be nearly identical.
                The S23 Ultra, however, performs better in low light. 
                However, the S23 Ultra performs better in low light. Apart from that, the S23 Ultra for video has three major upgrades.
                To start, 8K has been enhanced.
                Samsung devices can now shoot 8K content, but it does so at a rate of 24 frames per second, which is not the same as what the other cameras can do.
                Additionally, it only utilizes the middle portion of the sensor, drastically cropping the image.
                The S23 Ultra no longer significantly crops images, and you can shoot at 8K 30 frames per second with incredibly excellent, sharp outcomes.


                

              </p>

              <h2>S Pen</h2>
                <p>Talking about the S Pen.
                    The S Pen is therefore integrated into both tablets, and it remains the same.
                    Its 2.8-millisecond latency is still among the lowest available.
                    You have handwriting recognition, and Samsung has mentioned integrating with further Google apps.
                    I think the S22 Ultra should continue to receive this, hopefully.
                    
                    
                </p>
              

              <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
              <p>On the S23 Ultra, we get Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.2. Bluetooth 5.3 is reportedly expected to be more reliable. On both gadgets, we have powerful speakers—one at the earpiece and one at the bottom. The S23 Ultra does, however, sound superior.

            </p>


                <h2>Charging</h2>
              <p>In terms of charging, nothing has changed.
                As a result, we have wireless charging up to 15 watts, up to 45 watts of charging, Samsung's PowerShare reverse wireless charging, and a 50% charge in about 20 minutes.
                Therefore, behind both of these gadgets, you may charge things like your ear-buds.
                  
                </p>

                <h2>Storage And Pricing</h2>
              <p>
              
                    In comparison to the S22 Ultra, which has a starting storage capacity of 128 gigabytes, the S23 Ultra has 256 gigabytes, and both of them support storage capacities of up to one terabyte.
                    Furthermore, neither of these has extendable storage.
                    We haven't had expandable capacity on a Galaxy S handset for quite some time now, but I still feel compelled to mention it because some people will continue to inquire.
                    Pricing: The S23 Ultra starts at $1,200, which is the same price that the S22 Ultra did last year, but only in the US.
                    It does start off more expensive in the UK and other countries. The base model now comes with 256 GB of storage instead of the previous 128 GB. You can purchase the S22 Ulta for roughly $900 or 900 pounds on Amazon because it has been available for some time. Of course, if you purchase it used, refurbished, or renewed, you will be able to find it for less money.



                </p>

              
              

              
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>Nevertheless, if you ask me, should you go up to the S23 Ultra from the S22 Ultra?
                My response is "No."
                Yes, the new chipset, which will provide you with significantly improved performance and efficiency, brings some excellent enhancements, especially for the S23 Ultra.
                And of course, those upgrades to the video cameras specifically.
                However, in my opinion, that doesn't justify a switch from the S22 Ultra to the S23 Ultra.
                However, I do believe that the S23 Ultra is a nice improvement if you are coming from perhaps the S21 Ultra, the S20 Ultra, or something older.
                And if you already own one of those older models and are debating between purchasing the S22 Ultra or the S23 Ultra, in my opinion, you should choose the latter because, thanks to pre-order discounts and other offers, the S23 Ultra will only cost you a few hundred dollars, possibly a little more, than the S22 Ultra. Unless you can find it for a really, really good price. And that will give you those improvements and extend the lifespan of your items. At least, it is my opinion. What do you think, guys? Let me know by leaving a comment below. Thanks.
