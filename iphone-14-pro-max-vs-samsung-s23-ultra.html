              <p><span class="firstcharacter">H</span>aving the best from Samsung which is S23 Ultra compared to the best from iPhone which is iPhone 14 Pro max. Are you curious to just know the
                 best? Or do you want to buy one and look for the best one to buy, considering budget, design, lifespan, and more? In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the process, so you can easily choose the one 
                that best fits your need.  </p>

              <figure class="my-4 text-center" >
                <img src="assets/img/iphone-14-pro-max-vs-samsung-s23-ultra.jpg" alt="an image showing Samsung galaxy s23 ultra side-by-side with iphone 14 pro max"  width="60%" height="60%" class="img-fluid">
               
              </figure>
              <p>
                Below are factors you may consider in order for you to choose the right one for you.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Design</h2>

              <p>First of all, they both have large phones that weigh nearly the same. Both phones' designs are highly recognizable. The Samsung S23 Ultra shares similarities with the Samsung S22 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro Max also share a lot of similarities with the iPhone 13 Pro Max in terms of appearance. Both of them come in various colors. There are four color options for the iPhone 14 Pro Max: silver, gold, space black, and deep purple. The S23 Ultra is also available in four various colors, including lavender, green, cream, and phantom black, just like the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The finest feature of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is that it includes more exclusive colors, including red, sky blue, light, and graphite, which are exclusively available on
                <a href="https://samsung.com" style="color: blueviolet;">Samsung</a> 
              </p>

              <h2>Build</h2>
              <p>While the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has an aluminum frame, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has a stainless steel frame. The corners of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra are more squared off than those of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Additionally, both devices have an IP68 designation for water and dust protection.

              </p>

              <h2>Display</h2>
              <p>Let's now turn these things around and examine the displays.
                So let's start by examining the commonalities.
                Both use OLED technology, making the colors really stand out, and both feature adaptive refresh rates that go up to 120 hertz, which makes everything incredibly fluid.
                Additionally, down to just one hertz, which greatly improves efficiency and permits always-on displays.
                Therefore, the always-on screens on both smartphones are excellent. Their implementation differs from one another. iPhone 14 Pro Max's initial wallpaper was just darkened, which I found to be very distracting. Since then, a software update has been made available that enables you to have a blank, always-on display. The S23 Ultra does, however, feature a little better resolution, thus details will be marginally clearer. They might go unnoticed during your normal day. In fact, the iPhone 14 Pro Max's display is a little
                 bit brighter than the Samsung S23 Ultra, with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits as opposed to 1,750 nits. Therefore, if you're like me and frequently use your device outside in direct sunlight while wearing sunglasses, you'll appreciate the iPhone 14 Pro Max's modest advantage.
                </p>
              

              <h2>Face ID vs 3D Sonic Sensor</h2>
              <p>The iPhone 14 Pro Max has Face ID, thus all of the sensors are behind that area, which is another reason for the post-shaped notch.
                The S23 Ultra incorporates an in-display fingerprint scanner that uses ultrasound.
                One of my personal favorite fingerprint scanners on any smartphone is this 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2 model.
                Now, your daily life will determine whether you prefer the Face ID or the fingerprint scanner. Personally, I lean toward the fingerprint scanner because I enjoy using my phone when lying in bed with my face partially buried in the pillow. Using face ID requires you to sort of leave, but I don't have to do so with the S23 Ultra.
            </p>


                <h2>Cameras</h2>
              <p>I believe both gadgets produce high-quality images and videos.
                Both cameras have an ultra wide-angle lens, a primary lens, and a telephoto lens, but the S23 Ultra has two telephoto lenses and can provide you with a superior extended zoom.
                The primary camera of the S23 Ultra does have a much greater resolution, 200 megapixels, which does give you a lot more detail. I also did prefer the S23 Ultra for the ultra-wide camera.
                However, the S23 Ultra has a significant amount of shutter lag, so if you enjoy taking images of 
                children and animals, the iPhone 14 Pro Max will likely yield better results. Additionally,
                 I still think the footage on the iPhone 14 Pro Max was better overall because it was more 
                 dependable. Additionally, it includes a superior stabilization system and cinematic mode. 
                 Although the S23 Ultra now offers 8k at 30 frames per second, which is wonderful for capturing
                  plenty of information, when it comes to a video package, I would choose the iPhone 14 Pro Max.
                  If you must know, I would generally choose the S23 Ultra for photographs. However, I want to 
                  highlight once more that I wouldn't mind choosing either of these. If you're interested in the 
                  whole camera comparison, you can check out that full camera comparison.      
                </p>

                <h2>S Pen & DeX</h2>
              <p>
                describing a few of the extra functions that both devices provide.
                    Therefore, the S23 Ultra does contain a feature that you won't find on any iPhone, namely the S-Pen.
                    This gives you a level of precision that you simply won't get, and its latency is under 2.8 milliseconds.
                    So you'll be able to do that much more quickly with the S23 Ultra if you want to jot down some fast notes, do some doodles, alter some photographs, or even sign some documents.
                    This also functions remotely, so it's convenient to use as a remote trigger for the cameras. Additionally, the app includes handwriting recognition functionality. Even while I don't use the S-Pen all the time, I do truly appreciate it. The S23 Ultra does have DeX because it is a Samsung flagship product. With DeX, you can wirelessly project a full desktop experience from your smartphone onto a large screen and use your device as a touchpad to operate the mouse. It's incredible how many people still don't get this. 
                </p>

              
                <h2>Battery Life</h2>
              <p>The S23 Ultra does, in fact, have a bigger physical battery than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but as both devices run entirely different hardware and software, the size of the battery is irrelevant.
                The iPhone 14 Pro Max has now provided me with excellent battery life.
                So far, the S23 Ultra is actually keeping up and providing me with battery life that is comparable to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.
                Even though it's still early, the S22 Ultra was unquestionably inferior to the S23 Ultra. Additionally, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip-set, which we have, means that, in my experience so far, it is keeping up with the iPhone 14 Pro Max, and I believe both of these have perfect battery life.

                </p>

          
              <h2>Charging</h2>
              <p>Now that it can support the quicker 45-watt charge, the S23 Ultra has the advantage over the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which can only manage about 20 watts.
                Therefore, 50% will take about 30 minutes on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but only 20 minutes on the S23 Ultra.
                The S23 Ultra does support Qi wireless charging at up to 15 watts for wireless charging. Only MagSafe can provide 15 watts of charging power for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Although it only needs to be snapped on, MagSafe is a patented product. The S23 Ultra also supports Wireless PowerShare, allowing you to transfer power from one device to another. Although I hardly ever use it, it can be helpful if you're out and about and you just need to refuel your headphones or anything similar. If you are unaware, I should point you that chargers are not included in the boxes, therefore you will need to purchase them separately.

                </p>

              <h2>Storage and Price</h2>
              <p>
                Let's now examine pricing and storage.
                The S23 Ultra hence has a greater starting base model than the iPhone 14 Pro Max (128 gigabytes vs. 256), but both devices support storage capacities of up to one terabyte.
                Neither of these offers expandable storage, as you are either aware of this already or should be aware of it.
                Expandable storage was a feature of earlier Samsung smartphones many, many years ago, but it hasn't been available for quite some time.
                The 256-gigabyte devices really start at the same price in the US when compared to pricing. The iPhone 14 Pro Max does cost more in the UK and other countries than the S23 Ultra's corresponding capacity variants, though Samsung is also now selling the 512 GB model for the same price as the 256 GB model.
                Therefore, when you add everything up, the S23 Ultra will cost less overall than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.


                </p>

              
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro Max are so compared.
                What would I say?
                Personally, I truly enjoy using both of these gadgets, therefore I'll continue to carry both of them around with me.
                Naturally, each has advantages and cons.
                However, a lot of it will depend on which operating system you like.
                Which of these would you choose if you could only choose one?
                
                </p>
